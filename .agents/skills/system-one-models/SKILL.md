  Design AI-powered software with System One models (e.g. TypeSafe Jev):
  fast typed judgments (Choice, Score, Noul) with calibrated probabilities,
  not text generation. Covers design workflow, primitives, input structuring,
  LLM integration patterns, and empirical tradeoffs. Use when routing,
  ranking, extracting, verifying, guarding, or scoring unstructured input.

# Build with System One models

System One models make fast, structured judgments that software can consume directly.
They return typed answers and probabilities rather than generated text or reasoning
explanations. Code owns the workflow; the model supplies programmable common sense
where ordinary code needs semantic understanding.

> **Before designing your first workflow, read [references/empirical-findings.md](references/empirical-findings.md).**
> It captures the real-world tradeoffs, common failure modes, input structuring pitfalls,
> and model behavior quirks discovered during integration research. These apply broadly
> across System One models and save you debugging the same sharp edges from scratch.

## Read the docs

**The live docs for your System One model are the source of truth.** This skill gives
direction; the provider's docs carry current concepts, prompting guidance, API contracts,
SDK usage, models, limits, and worked examples.

- Providers define their own primitives, request/response shapes, SDKs, and model
  availability. Read their documentation before writing integration code.
- When working with TypeSafe's Jev, start with the
  [documentation index](https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt) to discover relevant pages
  and cookbooks. Use targeted reads rather than loading the entire site.
- When working with another System One provider, use their official docs.

## Find the useful shape

Start from the behavior the user wants: what will the application show, select,
change, or hand off? Work backward to the judgments it needs. Keep known rules,
calculations, exact lookups, and execution in code. Preserve the user's chosen stack
and scope; add the System One model where semantic understanding helps.

When brainstorming or choosing an architecture, consider more than classification.
The patterns below are starting points: combine primitives around the user's goal,
including ideas that do not fit an established recipe.

- **Route and fill known arguments.** A request can select a handler and its typed
  parameters. Ask useful branch-specific questions up front and consume only the
  relevant answers. See [function calling](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/function_calling.md)
  and [speculative fan-out](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/fan-out.md).
- **Select instead of generate.** Find candidate values or source spans in code,
  use a judgment to select the intended one, then copy or normalize it. Code can
  also assemble source text into a formatted document or reading guide. See
  [value extraction](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/pre_parsed_value_extraction_cookbook.md)
  and [structure recovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoformat.md).
- **Find and judge evidence.** Retrieve candidates, compare their relevance to a
  query, and select useful context. See [reranking](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/rerank_typesafe.md)
  and [hierarchical classification](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/hierarchical_classification.md).
- **Turn judgments into reusable data.** Score dimensions once, then let code or
  user controls change weights, thresholds, rankings, and views. With labeled
  outcomes, those signals can become classical ML features. See
  [composite scoring](https://docs.typesafe.ai/patterns/composite-scoring.md) and
  [feature discovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoresearch_feature_discovery.md).
- **Verify and escalate.** Check specific claims or fields against their evidence;
  send uncertain or failing cases to a person or reasoning model. See
  [citation checks](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/citation_check.md) and
  [extraction cascades](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/sde_cascade.md).
- **Respond to changing state.** Code can retain goals and observations while fresh
  judgments guide the next bounded step. Keep inferred state distinct from observed
  facts, and check freshness before applying a result to a changed situation.

For open-ended requests, offer the few directions that best serve the user's goal
and recommend a starting point. For a concrete request, choose the relevant pattern
and build; a brainstorm is not a mandatory detour.

## Design the judgments

System One models use three primitive types. Choose by what the answer means:

| Need | Primitive | Important distinction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One of a defined set | **Choice** | Picks one option; its probability distribution compares competing options |
| Whether a condition holds | **Noul** | Probability of yes; no separate confidence; use one per label when several may apply |
| Degree along a described dimension | **Score** | Probability-weighted position on ordered levels; use comparable per-item Scores for graded ranking |

Give each question enough relevant **state** to answer: source text, identities,
relationships, policies, and current facts. Prefer named JSON fields when context
has several parts. Put the judgment in **instructions** and define its possible
answers in **criteria**. Question IDs are for code and are not sent to the model;
include complete meaning in the question. Reference nested state with backticked
paths such as `ticket.messages[0].text`.

Ask one narrow, coherent judgment per question. Split independently useful dimensions,
without destroying the relationship being judged. A bounded action selection or
contextual interpretation is valid; atomic does not mean literal fact extraction
or a one-sentence limit. Strings work for simple questions. Use structured objects
or arrays when definitions, contrasts, exclusions, or examples clarify instructions
or criteria. Score levels must describe concrete situations and stand on their own.

Keep the needed answers available. Include a no-match outcome when nothing may fit;
use a separate presence judgment when it is independently useful. For source-value
selection, check candidate coverage: the model cannot choose an omitted value.

## Compose and verify

**Ask independent questions over the same state together**, including useful
speculative questions. They run in parallel and cannot see one another's answers.
State each speculative premise explicitly; code consumes the applicable answers.
A second request is warranted when an earlier answer is needed to fetch evidence,
construct new state, or determine the next options. Extra questions still use tokens;
measure actual request budgets, cost, and end-to-end latency.

Use probabilities and confidence to guide behavior, with thresholds evaluated on
the user's data and consequences. Choice/Score confidence summarizes distribution
concentration, not overall workflow correctness or permission to act. A Noul near
0.5 means similar probability for yes and no, not medium intensity. Several
acceptable alternatives can also spread probability; low confidence need not
invalidate a harmless preference choice. Ignore uncertainty on unused branches.

Keep policy explicit and raw judgments reusable. Weighted scores suit compensating
preferences; an "any serious violation" rule needs separate conditions. Changing a
weight or display filter need not rerun inference when evidence and question meanings
are unchanged. Typed output guarantees the interface, not truth. System One models
are trained for calibrated decisions; validate their performance in the target domain.

For patterns combining System One models with LLMs, see
[references/llm-integration.md](references/llm-integration.md) — the five cascade
patterns (gating, candidate selection, output verification, routing, ensemble features)
cover the most common architectures.

Test representative cases and the resulting application behavior. For failures,
inspect the exact state, questions, candidates, answers, composition, and observed
outcome. Separate missing evidence, model errors, code errors, and service failures.
Treat cookbook thresholds and demo results as examples to evaluate, not universal
rules or permanent model limitations. Keep API credentials server-side in web apps.
